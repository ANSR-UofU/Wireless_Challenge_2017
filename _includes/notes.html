<h3>Amateur Radio</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.arrl.org/ares" target="_blank">Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)</a>
   is in charge of providing communication support for government and
   non-governmental disaster response organizations during times of disaster
   using the Amateur Radio bands.</p>

<h3>CERT</h3>
<p>Response Teams use cell phones (if available) and ARES members to relay
   information when responding. When they respond, they provide light search and
   rescue and medical aid.</p>

<h3>American Red Cross</h3>
<p>People arriving at shelters complete registration papers which includes
   information for the <a href="https://safeandwell.communityos.org/cms/index.php" target="_blank">Safe and Well</a>
   program administered by the Red Cross. ARES members are used to provide
   communications when other infrastructure is compromised.</p>

<h3>S.A.F.E. Neighborhoods</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.safeutah.org/" target="_blank">S.A.F.E. Neighborhoods</a>
   is a program that started in Salt Lake County but is being replicated by
   other counties in Utah. As part of this program, elementary schools are used
   as hubs during disasters. Response kits are prepositioned at the elementary
   schools. After a disaster happens, the expectation is people will go to their
   nearest elementary school. Once there, people will complete
   <a href="https://safeandwell.communityos.org/cms/index.php" target="_blank">Safe and Well</a>
   information and try to self-organize. The plan is to also use the elementary
   schools as communication and transportation hubs.</p>
